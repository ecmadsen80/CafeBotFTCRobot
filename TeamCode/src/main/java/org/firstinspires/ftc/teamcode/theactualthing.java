/*
 * This OpMode illustrates how to use the Limelight3A Vision Sensor.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://limelightvision.io/">Limelight</a>
 *
 * Notes on configuration:
 *
 *   The device presents itself, when plugged into a USB port on a Control Hub as an ethernet
 *   interface.  A DHCP server running on the Limelight automatically assigns the Control Hub an
 *   ip address for the new ethernet interface.
 *
 *   Since the Limelight is plugged into a USB port, it will be listed on the top level configuration
 *   activity along with the Control Hub Portal and other USB devices such as webcams.  Typically
 *   serial numbers are displayed below the device's names.  In the case of the Limelight device, the
 *   Control Hub's assigned ip address for that ethernet interface is used as the "serial number".
 *
 *   Tapping the Limelight's name, transitions to a new screen where the user can rename the Limelight
 *   and specify the Limelight's ip address.  Users should take care not to confuse the ip address of
 *   the Limelight itself, which can be configured through the Limelight settings page via a web browser,
 *   and the ip address the Limelight device assigned the Control Hub and which is displayed in small text
 *   below the name of the Limelight on the top level configuration screen.
